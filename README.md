A tiny asynchronous library for Java.

Writing multithreaded code is hard, tiny async tries to make it easier by providing simple abstractions for executing and manipulating computations through a clean API abstraction.

# Why TinyAsync

In short; everything is tucked behind an API, and some functionality has been moved into the future itself to allow for cleaner code.

Google Guava provides the [Futures helper class](http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/util/concurrent/Futures.html) that allows the user of the library to do interesting things with their futures.

The issue I have with this pattern is that it is a leaky abstraction.

The use of for example ```Futures#transform(ListenableFuture<I> input, AsyncFunction<? super I,? extends O> function)``` directly in your code means that the specific code will always use a direct executor.
Since most of the future API is provided statically, there are no way to configure the helpers default behaviour, users are left to wrap Guava specifically for their application if they want to accomplish this.

TinyAsync attempts to address by allowing these aspects of the framework to be configured, see [AsyncSetup.java](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncSetup.java).

The benefits are;

* Your application only have to interact with TinyAsync through the  [AsyncFramework](tiny-async-api/src/main/java/eu/toolchain/async/AsyncFramework.java) interface, which is part of the API package. This allows for decoupling between implementation and API.
* TinyAsync can be configured with sensible defaults for _your_ application, and these can be enjoyed by all components without having to rewrite their code.
* Coupled with a dependency injection framework, your component does not have to pull in the actual implementation of their futures, everything is behind a clean API.

For an overview of the library, check out the
[API](tiny-async-api/src/main/java/eu/toolchain/async) and the [Usage](#usage)
section below.

# Setup

TinyAsync is available [through maven](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22eu.toolchain.async%2).

If you have an API project, you can add a dependency to **tiny-async-api**, which only contains the interfaces used by TinyAsync and with very little indirection is all you need to interact with the library.

If you have an application or framework that intends to provide an implementation of TinyAsync, you should depend on **tiny-async-core**. This contains the implementation of TinyAsync.

See [Api Separation](#api-separation) for why the api is distributed in a separate package.

After that, the first step is to instantiate the framework.

See [AsyncSetup.java](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncSetup.java)
for an example of how to do this.

# Api Separation

The separation between the API and core is done to reduce issues with drifts in dependencies.

A specific version of the API is always intended to be signature compatible with future versions, this means that if you build a project against version `1.1.0` of the API, it will be working with all `1.x.x` versions of Core.

Deprecated components will be removed in the next major version, and the package will be renamed to avoid future classpath conflicts.

# Usage

The following section contains documentation on how to use TinyAsync.

## Building futures from scratch

The following methods are provided on ```AsyncFramework``` to build new futures.

* ```ResolvableFuture<T> AsyncFramework#future()```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#call(Callable<T>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#call(Callable<T>, ExecutorService)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#call(Callable<T>, ExecutorService, ResolvableFuture<T>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#resolved(T)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#failed(Throwable)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#cancelled()```

The first kind of method returns a ```ResolvableFuture<T>``` instance. This is typically used when integrating with other async framework and has direct access to a ```#resolve(T)``` method that will resolve the future.

The methods that take a ```Callable<T>``` builds a new future that will be resolved when the given callable has returned.

The last kind of methods are the ones building futures which have already been either resolved, failed, or cancelled.
These types of methods are good for returning early from methods that only returns a future.
An example is if a method throws a checked exception, and you want this to be returned as a future, you can use ```AsyncFramework#failed(Throwable)```.

See examples:

* [blocking example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncBlockingExample.java)
* [static results example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncStaticResultsExample.java)
* [manually resolving a future](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncManualResolvingExample.java)

## Subscribing to changes

The following methods allow you to subscribe to interesting changes on the
futures.

* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFuture#on(FutureDone<T>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFuture#on(FutureFinished)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFuture#on(FutureCancelled)```

If the event handlers throw an exception, this is intepreted as an 'internal'
error, and will be reported as such in the provided ```AsyncCaller```.

There is no other reasonable way to handle this circumstance, and you are
expected to avoid throwing exceptions here (or implement a sane AsyncCaller
handle).

See examples:

* [subscribe example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncSubscribeExample.java)

## Blocking until a result is available

This is the implemented behaviour of ```java.util.concurrent.Future#get()```.

Blocking isn't a terribly interesting async behaviour, and frankly it is beyond
me why ```java.util.concurrent.Future``` is so poorly designed.

You should mostly rely on [Subscribing to events](#subscribing-to-events),
transformers and collectors.

Note: most of these examples make use of ```#get()```, mainly because it is
convenient in this contrived context.

See examples:

* [blocking example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncBlockingExample.java)

## Transforming results

Transformations is a lightweight way of forward potential results or failures.

They allow you to take a value A, and convert it to a value B.

They also allows to take a falied future, and convert it into a value B.

* ```AsyncFuture<C> AsyncFuture#transform(Transform<T, C>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<C> AsyncFuture#transform(LazyTransform<T, C>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<C> AsyncFuture#error(Transform<Throwable, C>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<C> AsyncFuture#error(LazyTransform<Throwable, C>)```

See examples:

* [transform example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncTransformExample.java)

## Collecting Many Results

When you have a collection of asynchronous computations, and you want a single
future that is resolved by them instead.

* ```AsyncFuture<Collection<T>> AsyncFramework#collect(Collection<AsyncFuture<C>>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<Void> AsyncFramework#collectAndDiscard(Collection<AsyncFuture<C>>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#collect(Collection<AsyncFuture<C>>, Collector<C, T>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<T> AsyncFramework#collect(Collection<AsyncFuture<C>>, StreamCollector<C, T>)```

The methods taking the ```Collector``` gathers the result of all computations,
and provides them to the ```Collector#collect(Collection<C>)``` method.
Since this is guaranteed to only be called once, it is very convenient.
It has the downside of requiring the result of all the collected futures to be
in memory at once.

The methods taking the ```StreamCollector``` also gathers the result of all
computations. However in contrast with ```Collector``` it provides methods to
incrementally gather the result of all the computations.
The intermidate result is discarded and can be effectivelly garbage collected
by the JVM.
Similarly to ```Collector```, ```StreamCollector``` has the
```StreamCollector#end(int, int, int)``` method that will be called when all
the computations have been finished.

See examples:

* [collector example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncCollectorExample.java)
* [stream collector example](tiny-async-core/src/example/java/eu/toolchain/examples/AsyncStreamCollectorExample.java)

## Managed References

Managed references are values which are reference counted by the framework.
These are intended to be used for expensive setup, and teardown operations,
where abruptly tearing the reference down while there are sessions using it can
cause undesirable behaviour.

* ```Managed<T> AsyncFramework#managed(ManagedSetup<T>)```
* ```AsyncFuture<Void> Managed#start()```
* ```AsyncFuture<Void> Managed#stop()```
* ```AsyncFuture<R> Managed#doto(ManagedAction<T>)```

The ```#managed(ManagerSetup<T>)``` method defines a constructor, and
a destructor for the given reference of type ```<T>```. The user is then
responsible for *borrowing* this reference through the
```Borrowed<T> Managed#borrow()``` method. As soon as this reference is no
longer needed, the user must manually de-allocate it.

The user should start and stop the managed reference. After
```Managed#stop()``` the reference will be destructed once the last borrowed
references are released.

The ```Managed#doto(ManagedAction<T>)``` method provides a convenience method
that will retain the managed reference, until the future returned is finished.
This is typically a strong indication that the reference is no longer required.
